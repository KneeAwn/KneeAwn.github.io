The way that I read things and want to provide information is in the following style:

1. *Bold Intro*
2. Paragraph expanding idea
3. Concise article.

The reason for this arrangement is to allow the reader to receive information at the level
they want. I hate reading articles that obfuscate the information that brought you there 
in the first place.
